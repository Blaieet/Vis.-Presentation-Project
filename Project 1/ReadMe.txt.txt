The Notebooks can be found in the /Notebooks folder.

The final dashboard can be found in the following URL: https://dashboardeuropeansoccerdata.herokuapp.com/

The GitHub with all the code implementation can be found here: https://github.com/Blaieet/Vis.-Presentation-Project

Inside this repository, in the App/Data/ folder you can see the data needed for the plots. 

The overall SQLite Database needed for all the plots, including the ones in the Notebooks, can be downloaded from here:
